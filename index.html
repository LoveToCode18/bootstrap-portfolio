       <p>I am very into Web Developing, I have great communication skills and I enjoy team settings, Iâ€™m currently a student at University of Utah, I'm studying Full Stack Web Developing. I love technology and have since a young age, I find electronics intriguing. I'm truly passionate about Web Developing, It excites me and I love the idea of learning new things and complex problem solving. I have a good grasp of the fundamentals of Web Developing, I always try to build upon those skills as well! I'm currently learning the MERN Stack at the U.

            When I'm not glued to my computer coding I am taking care of my daughter, she motivates me everyday to do better then I did yesterday . I am very much a people person, I love to meet new people and hear others opinions and ideas!
